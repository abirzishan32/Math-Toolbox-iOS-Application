## Math Toolbox
Math Toolbox is an iOS application built with SwiftUI that allows users to input mathematical equations and visualize their graphs in real time. Users can add multiple equations, zoom in/out, and control each graph's visibility, offering an interactive and educational experience.
Also user can use a scientific calculator and use basic calculations. Also user can solve equations and do matrix operations.

# Features
**1. Graph Plotter:**

  a. Equation Input: Enter any mathematical equation, such as 1/x, log(x), 2*x*x+4*x+5, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), etc.

  b. Graph Plotting: Plots each equation entered by the user in a distinct color.

  c. Zoom Control: Easily zoom in or out for closer inspection of the graph.

  d. Coordinate System: Displays a grid with labeled coordinates for reference.

  e. Real-Time Updates: Graphs are updated dynamically as equations are entered or modified.

  f. Equation Toggle: Enable or disable individual equations to show or hide their graphs.

**2. Equation Solver:**
a. Solver Selection: A segmented picker lets users select from four equation types: Polynomial Degree 2, Polynomial Degree 3. System with 2 Unknowns, System with 3 Unknowns.
b. Input Fields for Each Equation Type.

**3. Scientific Calculator:** Supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Scientific Mode Toggle: Enables advanced functions when scientific mode is toggled on.
Scientific Functions: Includes trigonometric (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic (ln, log), power functions (square, cube, power), and constants (Ï€, e).

**4. Matrix Operation:** Supports matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication and inversion with user input size of each matrix.
