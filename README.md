## Math Toolbox
Math Toolbox is an iOS application built with SwiftUI that allows users to input mathematical equations and visualize their graphs in real time. Users can add multiple equations, zoom in/out, and control each graph's visibility, offering an interactive and educational experience.
Also user can use a scientific calculator and use basic calculations. Also user can solve equations and do matrix operations.

# Features
**1. Graph Plotter:**

  a. Equation Input: Enter any mathematical equation, such as 1/x, log(x), 2*x*x+4*x+5, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), etc.

  b. Graph Plotting: Plots each equation entered by the user in a distinct color.

  c. Zoom Control: Easily zoom in or out for closer inspection of the graph.

  d. Coordinate System: Displays a grid with labeled coordinates for reference.

  e. Real-Time Updates: Graphs are updated dynamically as equations are entered or modified.

  f. Equation Toggle: Enable or disable individual equations to show or hide their graphs.
